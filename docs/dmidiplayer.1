MIDI ports and also software synths.

.SS Standard Options
.PP
The following options apply to all Qt5 applications:
.TP
-style= \f[I]style\f[R] / -style \f[I]style\f[R]
Set the application GUI style.
Possible values depend on the system configuration.

Set the application styleSheet.
The value must be a path to a file that contains the Style Sheet.
.TP
-widgetcount
Print debug message at the end about number of widgets left undestroyed
and maximum number of widgets existed at the same time.
.TP
-reverse
Set the application\[cq]s layout direction to Qt::RightToLeft.
This option is intended to aid debugging and should not be used in
production.
The default value is automatically detected from the user\[cq]s locale
(see also QLocale::textDirection()).

Use the FreeType font engine.
.SS Arguments
.TP
\f[I]midi_files\f[R]
Input MID/KAR/RMI/WRK file name(s).
The set of provided file names becomes a temporary playlist.
.SH FILES
.TP
\f[I]*.lst\f[R]
Playlist files.
The last opened or saved playlist file shall be remembered the next time
the program is started, but playlists are not saved automatically.
.RS
.PP
Playlists are simple text files, with a file name on each text line.
The file names can be relative to the location of the playlist file
itself (so they do not have an absolute path prepended) or each file can
have an absolute path on its own.
.PP
Users may have several playlists that can be created easily outside of
the program, for instance in the Linux command line this command creates
a playlist file named \[lq]my_playlist.lst\[rq] with all the MIDI files
located at the working directory:
.RE
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ ls -1 *.mid > my_playlist.lst
\f[R]
.fi
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\f[B]DRUMSTICKRT\f[R]
Location of Drumstick::RT plugins.
Useful if the plugins are not installed at a standard place.
